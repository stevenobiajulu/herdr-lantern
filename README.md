# Lantern, by Elves

![Lantern, illuminating your herd](assets/lantern-banner.jpeg)

**v0.16.0** is a [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin (`aigora.lantern`).

From the team that brought you [Elves](https://github.com/aigorahub/elves).

**[Use Lantern teams](https://aigorahub.github.io/herdr-lantern/teams.html)**
for parallel repo work, model discussions, and drivers with helpers. The guide
includes copyable examples and a request builder for work through review and merge.

Herdr manages the herd. The herd is in the field. Lantern illuminates
the field: who needs you, what they are working toward, jump to a pane,
start a new agent. The sidebar already marks working, blocked, done, or
idle. This plugin does not replace Herdr or wrap the agent CLIs.

It opens as a chat tab in its own Herdr workspace and starts the helper CLI
you already use (Cursor `agent`, Devin, Claude Code, Codex, or Grok). That
CLI drives `herdr`.

Requires Herdr **0.7.5+** and Python 3 on macOS, Linux, or Windows. Model
routing accepts `python3`, `python`, or the Windows `py -3` launcher. Windows
also needs Git for Windows. See [Windows](#windows).

## Install the plugin

One command after Herdr is installed (installs the plugin and opens it):

```bash
herdr plugin install aigorahub/herdr-lantern && herdr plugin action invoke aigora.lantern.open
```

Or run `install.sh` from a checkout. The first lantern chat asks what to
open when you just name a repo (harness, model, setting). After that,
"open battle-paddle" uses that default.

If you already have a coding agent open, paste the block at the top of
[the guide](https://aigorahub.github.io/herdr-lantern/).

From the marketplace / GitHub:

```bash
# If you previously used `herdr plugin link` for this repo, unlink first.
herdr plugin unlink aigora.lantern
herdr plugin install aigorahub/herdr-lantern
```

Local checkout while developing:

```bash
herdr plugin link /path/to/herdr-lantern
```

Do not run link and GitHub install at the same time for the same plugin id.

### Updates

At light-up the lantern checks whether a newer version is published and, if
one is, offers the update. It asks first and never upgrades itself silently.
There is no `herdr plugin update`; a GitHub install refreshes by running the
install command above again, and from inside the chat that goes through the
same mutate gate as everything else. A linked checkout is never reinstalled
over — the lantern says the checkout is behind and leaves the `git pull` to
you. After an update, quit the chat and reopen the lantern; the note under
[Open it](#open-it) about a leftover tab applies. The check is one
background fetch of the published manifest with a few seconds' budget, so it
never delays the light-up; offline, or before the fetch lands, the lantern
says nothing about updates.

## Pick your helper CLI

The lantern chat runs **one** CLI. That is independent of the spawn
default (`HELPER_SPAWN_KIND`, `HELPER_SPAWN_MODEL`, `HELPER_SPAWN_EFFORT`),
which is what Lantern opens when you name a repo and no harness, model, or
setting.

Leave `HELPER_AGENT` empty to use the first of `agent`, `devin`, `claude`, `codex`,
`grok`, `pi` on `PATH`. Launch prepends `~/.local/bin`, `~/bin`, and Homebrew.

| Helper you want | Install that CLI | `helper.conf` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor Ultra | Cursor CLI on `PATH` as `agent` (also `cursor-agent`) | `HELPER_AGENT="agent"` · `HELPER_MODEL="grok-4.7-high-fast"` (empty uses the model policy `routes.cursor.helper_model`, shipped as that) · `HELPER_PERMISSION="smart"` (`--auto-review`) |
| Devin | [Devin CLI](https://docs.devin.ai) — typically `~/.local/bin/devin` | `HELPER_AGENT="devin"` · leave `HELPER_MODEL` empty (Free rejects `--model`; Devin uses `~/.config/devin/config.json`) · `HELPER_PERMISSION="smart"` |
| Claude Code | [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs) on `PATH` as `claude` | `HELPER_AGENT="claude"` · optional `HELPER_MODEL` · optional `HELPER_EFFORT` (`--effort`) |
| Codex | [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) on `PATH` as `codex` | `HELPER_AGENT="codex"` · optional `HELPER_MODEL` · optional `HELPER_EFFORT` (`model_reasoning_effort`) |
| Grok | Grok CLI on `PATH` as `grok` (often `~/.grok/bin`) | `HELPER_AGENT="grok"` · optional `HELPER_MODEL` · optional `HELPER_EFFORT` (`--reasoning-effort`) |
| Pi | Pi CLI on `PATH` as `pi` (typically `~/.local/bin/pi`) | `HELPER_AGENT="pi"` · optional `HELPER_PROVIDER` (`--provider`) · optional `HELPER_MODEL` (`--model`; supports `provider/id`) · optional `HELPER_EFFORT` (`--thinking`) |

Each person on the team sets their own file. Nobody shares one model string.

```bash
$EDITOR "$(herdr plugin config-dir aigora.lantern)/helper.conf"
```

```sh
HELPER_AGENT="agent"         # agent, devin, claude, codex, grok, pi; empty = first on PATH
HELPER_MODEL="grok-4.7-high-fast"  # optional --model; leave empty for Devin
HELPER_PROVIDER=""           # pi only: --provider; unused by other helpers
HELPER_EFFORT=""             # unused for Devin and Cursor agent; pi -> --thinking <value>
HELPER_CWD="~"               # search root mentioned to the helper
HELPER_SPAWN_KIND="claude"   # default --kind when you just name a repo
HELPER_SPAWN_MODEL=""        # spoken phrase or id; empty = that kind's live default
HELPER_SPAWN_EFFORT=""       # optional extra effort when the model id lacks one
HELPER_PERMISSION="smart"    # devin / agent: auto | accept-edits | smart | dangerous; pi: accepted and ignored — no flags
HELPER_EXTRA_ARGS=""         # extra unquoted CLI tokens
```

`launch.sh` parses `KEY=value` only; it does not source the file as shell.

The helper prompt is copied once to `prompt.md` in the same config directory
and is never overwritten. After upgrading the plugin, copy the new
`prompt.md` from the repo over that file if you want the latest rules. Devin
also gets the same text as `.windsurf/rules/lantern.md` in the plugin
state workdir. Cursor `agent` gets `.cursor/rules/lantern.mdc`. Claude
Code gets `CLAUDE.md`.

On light-up it snapshots the field (`bin/goals-floor`): pane titles, Claude
`/goal` / recap lines, and who is waiting on you. Ask “what are they
working toward?” for that readout. Ask “Field Status” or “what’s going on”
to open a compact right-side pane beside Lantern Home. The repo-backed
`bin/field_status.py` reads Herdr tabs, agents, and workspaces and shows ET
date/time, separate red Important and purple Needs You sections, and every
open tab. Human-readable workspace names are yellow; In Motion, Done, and
Keep are yellow, green, and blue section headers. Keep shows Lantern Home and
only other sessions explicitly pinned by the user; hiding a quiet tab does not
close it. Done agents show a verified short outcome, and verified settled
sessions disappear immediately after closure. Daily Tasks and Lantern Home
are never closed by this view. The watcher redraws when field state or
notes change and leaves command transcripts out of the chat.

Lantern keeps Field Status rows and notes in `$LANTERN_HERD_STATE_DIR`, outside
the repo. The runtime prompt calls the detected Python 3 command with
`$LANTERN_FIELD_STATUS pane` to open or reuse the view. For a plain snapshot,
use `python bin/field_status.py --state-dir <private-state-dir> --plain refresh`.
Monitor events can set or clear notes with `note needs-you set|clear <id>` and
`note important set|clear <id>`. A Needs You note must name the exact action
for the user; noteworthy status or review gates with no user action belong
under Important. Legacy review-gate notes display under Important until cleared.
Use `note keep set|clear <pane-or-tab-id>` only for an explicitly requested
Keep entry, and `note done set|clear <pane-id>` for a verified short outcome.

Lantern works great with Elves. Without Elves it is still the Herdr
plugin: workspaces, panes, agents. If `.elves-session.json` files exist,
it also snapshots those runs (`bin/elves-floor`). Ask “how’s the night
shift?” It does not cobble or land.

Mutating `herdr` commands (create, start, focus, close, …) go through
`bin/herdr`, which reruns them with `HERDR_HELPER_OK=1`. Ask for
something and the lantern does it, then tells you what it did. It stops
to ask only when the ask itself is unclear: no target named ("clean
up"), or a name that matches two repositories. Closing, killing, and
removing are not exceptions. It never closes the lantern's own tab.

Agents the lantern seats for you start without stopping for ordinary
approvals. `agent start` passes each kind's own flags after `--`: Claude
Code and Grok get `--permission-mode auto`, Cursor `agent` gets
`--auto-review --trust`, Codex gets
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` so a Codex tab does not wait
for command or sandbox confirms. The herdr wrapper puts that Codex flag
immediately after `--`, including when the seat omitted it or placed it
after resume or review. Kinds without a listed tier get no extra flags.
bypassPermissions, `--yolo`, `--force`, and `--always-approve` stay off
unless the user asks for yolo and confirms the exact flag and the protections it removes.
Pi has no permission modes: `HELPER_PERMISSION` is accepted and ignored for
Pi, and Lantern never passes any approval-bypass flag to it. A Claude folder
trust card that highlights `No, exit` gets Down, then Enter only when the
marker is on `Yes, I trust this folder`. An older card still gets one Enter.

Seat language selects the CLI and model separately. "Cursor" uses `--kind
cursor` with the live Cursor default. Bare "Grok", "Grok Build", and
"SuperGrok" use `--kind grok`. The shipped Grok default is
`grok-4.7-build-fast` at medium effort. Every default comes from the model
policy; see [Model policy](#model-policy). "In Cursor with Grok" uses `--kind cursor`. "Fugu" uses
`--kind codex` with the `codex-fugu` profile (`-p fugu`) and a model from
the installed `fugu.json`. The default is regular `fugu` at high effort.
Fugu Max, Ultra, and effort max are selected only when the user names them.
Lantern checks the selected model with `bin/model-preflight` before it
seats anything. It stops on a failed check or a model it knows
will not work, and names one live substitute. A usage line with no reset
time is still valid. Missing quota info on a harness that has no usage
command is not a failed check.

"There is a PR on battle-paddle, get a Codex review" is a review route.
Lantern resolves the repository and pull request with Git and `gh`. It checks
the model before it creates a workspace or tab. It reuses a matching Codex,
Cursor, Cursor Grok, or Grok Build agent. Otherwise it seats the requested
kind with its real review or read-only plan command. Lantern never checks out
the pull request or edits the product repository.

GitHub repositories Lantern creates are private. `gh repo create` always
includes `--private`. It does not pass `--public` unless you explicitly ask
for a public repo.

After a seat the lantern renames the agent's tab to
`<slug> · <kind>` and says in one line what is running where: the slug, the
kind, the live model, effort, fast state, and the task the agent was given, or
that it has the workspace brief and no task yet.

Every fresh seat gets one opening prompt. The prompt tells the agent to load
the herdr skill, how to prompt the other agents in that workspace, and to put
more work in a new tab instead of splitting its own tab. The herdr skill
defaults to a sibling pane. This prompt overrides that default. A resume does
not send the prompt again.

## Temporary Codex jobs and cleanup

Lantern keeps full interactive Herdr agents as the default. They are the right
route when work needs repeated steering, resume, team coordination, or a
durable live session.

When you explicitly call a bounded Codex task temporary, disposable,
low-importance, one-shot, or Daily-Tasks-style, Lantern can use
`bin/codex-headless` instead. Read-only research runs in `research` mode;
bounded edits run in `update` mode. Both use `codex exec --ephemeral`, so the
job does not persist a normal Codex desktop session. The launcher performs the
live Codex model route and preflight, passes the task on stdin, and saves the
final response privately under Lantern state outside the product checkout.
It does not create a Herdr workspace, tab, or agent for the job.

The headless route deliberately has no resume, fork, arbitrary native-flag,
or dangerous-bypass surface. Research is read-only. Updates use Codex's
workspace-write automatic review mode. Codex login is inherited in place;
Lantern does not copy, serialize, or print authentication/config material. A
successful update still requires inspection of the real diff and the repo's
required tests. If a one-shot job needs steering, move the work to a fresh
interactive agent—an ephemeral job cannot be resumed.

For Daily-Tasks, use the pinned profile:

```powershell
bin\codex-headless.cmd research --profile daily-tasks --job state-2026-09-15 "Read the durable context and report today's state. Do not edit or send external messages."
```

It always reads durable context from `C:\Claude\Daily-Tasks` and resolves the
model phrase `5.6 luna xhigh fast`. `research` cannot edit. Use `update` only
for an explicitly authorized bounded edit. Every instruction needs a unique
job slug and starts a fresh `codex exec --ephemeral` run; there is no session
to resume and no normal Codex desktop/web history entry.

Ask `clean completed sessions in <repo or workspace>` to clean a named scope.
Lantern closes only settled tabs whose edit results are committed with a clean
checkout, or whose non-edit findings are durably saved; whose required task,
repository, dependency, and integration checks pass; and which have no active
task, handoff, child, monitor, or downstream consumer depending on the live
session. It rechecks identity and repository state immediately before close
and reports failed gates without closing those tabs. Workspace cleanup requires
every child tab to pass. Worktree removal remains separate. The Lantern home
tab, pane, and workspace are never cleanup targets. `close bar` remains the
stricter merged-main-and-deploy workflow.

At the end of the day, run this from a terminal outside the Lantern pane:

```powershell
hsh evening
```

`hsh nightly` is an alias. Lantern dependency-audits the field, preserves all
active, unresolved, ambiguous, or depended-on workspaces, and closes only
completed workspaces explicitly marked temporary that pass every cleanup
gate. It then atomically writes a compact private handoff with durable results,
pending dependencies, failed gates, and morning actions. The outer action
verifies a new handoff ID before it closes the Lantern home pane. For a Codex
Lantern, launch also stores only `CODEX_SESSION_ID` and the exact pane/workspace
IDs in private plugin state. Evening captures the exact Codex PID, closes that
pane, proves both pane and process exited, and only then calls the supported
`codex delete <UUID> --force`. That removes the old Lantern chat and its
associated child-agent records from normal Codex desktop history. It never
deletes the running session and never edits Codex history files directly.

If the identity receipt is missing/mismatched, process exit cannot be proved,
the installed Codex lacks exact deletion, or deletion fails, evening exits
nonzero, plainly reports that history cleanup is incomplete, and leaves the
saved session in place. Handoff failure still leaves Lantern home open. Herdr's
server and preserved work are never stopped, so you can close the Herdr window
normally after successful cleanup.

In the morning, run:

```powershell
hsh morning
```

That opens a fresh Lantern session, loads the handoff, reconciles it against
the live field, and attaches Herdr when run outside it. Windows users can put
the included `hsh.cmd` on `PATH` and use `bin\codex-headless.cmd`; Git Bash
users can use `hsh` and `bin/codex-headless` directly.

How to use it (GitHub Pages, after this lands on `main`):
[aigorahub.github.io/herdr-lantern](https://aigorahub.github.io/herdr-lantern/).
Team setup notes: [howto.html](howto.html). Changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Ship work across repos

Name the repos and the result you want. Ask Lantern to choose useful work:

```text
Ship high ROI issue fixes in storefront, billing-api, and admin-console.
Ship performance improvements in storefront and billing-api.
```

Or name the changes:

```text
Ship saved carts in storefront and invoice exports in billing-api.
```

Ship means the full job through clean merge. Agents check relevant issues,
comments, docs, and related PRs before they plan. They use existing issues
when available and check for work already in progress or already fixed.
Broad goals select one bounded batch per repo. Named tasks keep their scope.
Performance work needs a baseline and evidence of improvement. If no useful
work fits the goal, Lantern reports the checked evidence and records that
no change is needed. It does not create a PR for that result.

Lantern states the targets and starts the repos in parallel within available
capacity. Drivers open draft PRs early, handle independent reviews and fixes,
update docs and versions, merge when clean, and check deployment. Lantern
handles routine scoped permissions and asks only when a decision blocks
progress. It reports the PR and result for each repo, including any block.

Lantern keeps the work moving. It tracks each assigned task and its next
step in a persistent list. A recurring monitor checks progress, grants
routine permissions, resumes stopped sessions, and directs idle drivers to
the next gate. It verifies results before marking tasks done and stops the
monitor when all selected work is done. It keeps other repos moving when
one needs your decision. Ask `status` to see progress.

Keep Lantern open during the run. It uses a native recurring job when its
host provides one, or an active check loop otherwise. Reopen Lantern after
a restart to recover unfinished work. If every remaining task needs your
input, Lantern reports the blocks and pauses checks until you answer.

Add `stop before merge` or `PRs only` to keep the work unmerged. That stop
point overrides earlier broader authority. Use saved model preferences or
name a model in the request. There is no required command syntax or run name.

### Put a team on one task

Ask for a lead with helpers, or compare proposals from several models:

```text
Brainstorm ways to simplify onboarding. Have three models compare approaches.
Investigate slow checkout. Give the driver database and frontend helpers.
Ship saved carts in storefront. Use helpers where useful.
Ship high ROI issue fixes in storefront, billing-api, and admin-console. Run two repos at once, with up to two helpers per driver.
Have Claude and Codex propose solutions independently, then compare them.
```

The lead assigns bounded work and combines the results. For brainstorming,
agents prepare separate first proposals. They then critique the proposals
before the lead makes a recommendation. Missing evidence and unresolved
differences remain in the report. Brainstorming and investigation stop with
findings. They do not authorize edits or merge.

Use Elves 2.37.0 or later for team assignments and the callback adapter.
Lantern supports native Windows. Elves team execution on Windows requires
WSL2. The executable, state, and credential paths must be valid inside the
Elves environment; native Windows paths cannot be used unchanged in WSL2.
Saved model routes and substitute choices belong to Elves. Lantern reuses
them. Named models and team limits take priority. Without a requested count,
a comparison starts with a lead and two proposers. Helpers cannot expand
the team or change their own scope.

Writers use separate worktrees and assigned paths. The Elves driver owns
dependencies and integration. Contributors can discuss findings, but an
author or substantive design contributor cannot provide the final independent
review. Prefer another model family. A separate qualified agent from the
same family is valid when no other family is available under the saved choices.

Agents send persistent reports through `bin/team-mailbox`. The Elves adapter
consumes reports at safe checkpoints. Messages survive a busy chat or process
exit, but they do not wake an agent automatically. Herdr event observation
provides hints for the existing monitor. It does not prompt chats. Lantern
continues scheduled checks and verifies evidence before it marks work done.

Each local credential binds one actor to its run, tasks, session, model, and
permitted peers. Credentials stay outside repos and logs. A report can request
help; it cannot grant permission, replace a model, or authorize merge.
The transport uses Python's standard library and a private local SQLite store.
Launch exports native callback paths as `LANTERN_TEAM_MAILBOX` and
`LANTERN_TEAM_STATE_DIR` for the Elves adapter. Exact registration retries
preserve credentials after process failure. Retired actors retain access to
inspect their archived messages, but cannot send or consume further work.
Use the [interactive team guide](https://aigorahub.github.io/herdr-lantern/teams.html)
for copyable requests and a request builder.

See the [team rules](herd-workflows.md#teams-on-one-task) and
[callback protocol](plans/team-protocol-v1.md) for setup and recovery.

### Other workflow phrases

Lantern starts and monitors selected work across many repos through clean
merge. Each Elves run has one live driver. That driver owns changes, run
records, independent review, fixes, and authorized merge. Lantern monitors
from its home tab and raises only decisions that need you.

| Say this | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sweep battle-paddle, image-maker with astra high` | One audit agent per repo. High ROI issues only. Stop before Elves. |
| `issue harvest battle-paddle, image-maker` | Read open issues. Bring a menu of 1-3 landable runs per repo. You pick. |
| `stage relay recovery on battle-paddle with astra high` | Plan PR if needed, implementation draft PR, worktree, and exact phase routes. Stop before execution. |
| `landable loop relay recovery on battle-paddle with astra high, merge when clean` | Audit, stage, execute, independent review, fix, re-review, docs + changelog + version, driver merge, GitHub version, deploy check, pull main, report closable. |
| `parallel pack relay recovery on battle-paddle and export fixes on image-maker with astra high, merge when clean` | Start the selected independent runs. Continue healthy runs when another blocks. |
| `cutoff resume relay recovery` | Exact session, same kind and model, same worktree and phase. No silent substitute. |
| `close bar` | List merged tabs on current main with a passed deploy check or a stated deployment block. You name what to close. |

For `landable loop` and `parallel pack`, omit `merge when clean` to stop at a
landable PR unless you already gave merge authority for that run. A sweep, harvest, or stage never grants merge authority.
Lantern never merges or edits product repositories. It never prompts a working
chat. A login picker gets one exact process restart, with no input keys.
Lantern grants routine permissions within the selected run's scope. It reads
the blocked prompt, selects a visible allow once option, and checks progress.
It does not enable broad bypass settings or approve work outside that scope.
Lantern never closes its home tab. See [the herd contract](herd-workflows.md).

Run ownership and phase records come from the installed Elves skill. Prewalk
uses one worker session and one packet. Its supervisor resumes the same session
on the bound execute route. Review uses an independent session. Parallel
batches within a repo belong to that repo's driver and Elves lane checks.

New implementation work gets a draft PR at the first useful push, before
bulk execution. The driver reuses that PR and checks whether the configured
bots review drafts or need a documented request. Lantern tracks the PR and
bot state. The driver reads findings at safe batch boundaries. Bots that
skip drafts remain a recorded block while work continues. Incomplete work
stays in draft. Early bot reviews do not replace final independent review.

`herd-workflows.md` loads on each launch, even with a saved custom prompt.
Reopen Lantern after an upgrade to load it.

## Model policy

Default models and model bans live in data, not code. Lantern ships
`model-policy.json` at the plugin root and lays your own
`model-policy.json` from the config directory over it:

```bash
$EDITOR "$(herdr plugin config-dir aigora.lantern)/model-policy.json"
```

The override can change each kind's default route, the spawn and helper
defaults used when `helper.conf` leaves them empty, and a `forbid` list
(fast routes, service tiers, model families) that the resolver, preflight,
`bin/herdr` agent start, onboard, and the helper launch all enforce. A
malformed override stops Lantern with a message rather than falling back.
`bin/model-route policy` prints the effective policy and
`bin/model-route policy-prompt` prints the section launch injects. Schema
and merge rule: [docs/model-policy.md](docs/model-policy.md).

## Live model routes

`bin/model-route` reads the installed catalogs and returns separate argv.
`bin/model-preflight` checks the resolved route before a herd change. The
defaults below are the shipped policy; your override can change them.

- Codex: `astra`, `gpt-6 astra`, and `astra high` select `gpt-6-astra`.
  The shipped default is live Astra at its catalog effort, currently medium, with
  Fast off. The route sets `service_tier="default"` to override inherited
  priority settings. Efforts are low, medium, high, xhigh, max, and ultra. Bare
  `gpt-6` requires a choice. It never silently selects GPT-5.5.
- Claude: `fable high`, `fable 5.1 high`, and `claude-fable-5-1 high`
  resolve to `claude-fable-5-1`. The live initialization response supplies
  the exact model and its effort levels. Fable 5.1 supports low, medium,
  high, xhigh, and max. It keeps the Fable quota check and substitute consent.
- Cursor: `fable 5.1 high` and `fable 5.1 thinking high` select the exact
  `claude-fable-5-1-*` entries. Cursor Astra remains unavailable unless
  `agent --list-models` adds it. The Cursor default remains live Sol high Fast.

The 2026-09-05 check differs from the kickoff catalog. Codex now lists Astra
Fast with tier ID `priority`. The default keeps it off. A Fast request needs
one live Fast tier ID. Tests also cover catalogs with no Fast tier. Claude
Code 2.1.257 help still gives `claude-fable-5` as an example. Its live SDK
initialization response lists `claude-fable-5-1[1m]` with
`resolvedModel: claude-fable-5-1`. The wrapper reads that response in safe
mode with session persistence off. It sends no model prompt. Help examples
are not a model allowlist. Cursor lists Fable 5.1 and does not list Astra.

Anthropic confirms the [Fable 5.1 model ID](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/fable).
The [Agent SDK reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript)
describes model discovery through its initialization response.

A model check does not prove transport access. Agy needs local state and a
localhost port. Elves Grok review needs its runner sandbox. OMP needs its
state directory and configured auth broker. Report a denied resource as a
transport block. Do not change models to fix it. A named Claude Code review
must not become an OMP or Cursor review without a user choice.

Agy reviews and re-reviews always use `/boost` in plan mode. The default
review preference is `gemini-3.8-flash-high` when listed (the shipped model policy `routes.agy.default`). Each reviewer uses
a separate session from the code writers. If Boost fails or its activation
cannot be confirmed, the route is unavailable. Use an already approved
independent fallback or report a block. Plain Agy does not satisfy review.
Use a supervised Agy terminal seat until headless transport passes a live
qualification. Pass the absolute workspace to all Boost workers. Keep the
seat open while children work, and approve only required review actions.
A parent success or delegation notice is not a final review. Record the
exact commit, session, model, child completion, and findings.
A clean Agy review also needs context coverage. Read changed files, relevant
callers, tests, instructions, and task docs. The host checks the coverage
record against the diff and read evidence. Missing required context blocks
a clean result.

`/grill-me` stays an optional planning interview. See the
[Boost documentation](https://www.antigravity.google/docs/boost/).

## Open it

```bash
hsh
```

That runs `herdr plugin action invoke aigora.lantern.open`. Put `hsh`
from this repo on your `PATH` (for example `ln -s "$PWD/hsh" ~/bin/hsh`).
Run it from your own terminal. Inside the lantern's pane `herdr` is the
mutate-gated wrapper, and opening a second lantern is a change like any
other, so there it asks first rather than doing it.

On Windows there is no symlink step. Either run the action directly:

```powershell
herdr plugin action invoke aigora.lantern.open
```

or put a one-line `hsh.cmd` somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bat
@echo off
herdr plugin action invoke aigora.lantern.open
```

Once it is installed, open it in Herdr with **Ctrl+B, then capital H**.
`prefix+h` is already “focus pane left”, so the binding has to be capital H:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+H"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "aigora.lantern.open"
description = "Open lantern"
```

Then `herdr server reload-config`. No Herdr restart is needed for plugin
script or config edits; reopen the lantern.

Quit the chat before you upgrade, relink, or reinstall the plugin.
`herdr plugin install` and `herdr plugin link` drop Herdr's record of a
running lantern pane, so that tab stops answering to
`herdr plugin pane focus` and the next open seats a fresh chat beside it.
Close the leftover tab with `herdr pane close <pane_id>` if that happens.

## Where it sits

The first open creates a workspace labelled **🔥 lantern** at your home
directory and seats the chat there as a tab named **home** — suffixed with
what the chat runs, `home · claude · opus` say, so the sidebar says which
CLI and model is answering. The chat's first line names the same. It does not
drop a tab into whatever workspace you are in, and it closes the empty
shell tab the new workspace comes with, so the workspace holds the chat
alone. The lantern in the sidebar is how you find it at a glance.

Every later open reuses it. A chat that is still running is focused
wherever it sits, so moving or renaming that tab is safe. If the chat has
exited, Lantern seats a new one in the same workspace and closes nothing
else. It does not open a second lantern workspace, and two fast key
presses cannot race into two.

Lantern remembers both ids under the plugin state directory
(`workspace.id`, `pane.id`) and checks them before it uses them: Herdr
reuses ids after a restart, so a remembered workspace counts only while it
still carries the `🔥 lantern` label, and a remembered pane only while it
is still a lantern chat. Keep that label if you want the workspace reused
after the chat closes. Rename it and the next open makes a fresh one.

A new workspace lands **last** in the sidebar. There is no pin-to-top;
drag it where you want it.

The chat runs in the plugin state workdir. Home is only where the
workspace sits and the search root the helper is told about
(`HELPER_CWD`). Your repositories keep their own workspaces.

The tab closes when the helper CLI exits, and the lantern workspace goes
with it when that chat was the only tab in it. Herdr does not take Escape
until then; Escape stays inside the CLI.

For Cursor `agent`: **Ctrl+C** (twice if a turn is running), or **Ctrl+D** on an
empty prompt.

## Windows

Herdr ships for Windows, and so does this plugin. It runs the same POSIX shell
files there, through Git Bash. There is no separate Windows code path.

You need:

- Herdr for Windows.
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- Python 3 through `python3`, `python`, or `py -3`. Lantern stops before any
  seat change if none of these commands works.
- `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` on your user `PATH`. That directory holds
  `sh.exe`, and Herdr starts the plugin with `sh open.sh` and `sh launch.sh`.
  The Git installer does not put it there: its default option adds
  `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`, which holds `git.exe` and no shell. So this step
  is needed even when Git already works in your terminal. Add that one
  directory. Do not add `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`: it would shadow Windows
  tools such as `find.exe` and `sort.exe`, and the plugin does not need it.
- One helper CLI on `PATH`, the same as anywhere else.

After you add that PATH entry, **stop the Herdr server**, not just the window:

```powershell
herdr server stop
```

Herdr keeps a persistent server, and your panes live inside it. Closing and
reopening the app leaves that server running with the environment it started
with, so it still cannot find `sh` and the action fails with
`program not found`. Stopping the server ends every pane in it, so finish what
is running first.

A new PATH entry also has to reach whatever launches Herdr. The Start menu and
the taskbar are Explorer, and Explorer keeps the environment it started with
too. Sign out and back in, or restart Explorer, before you start Herdr again.
Confirm it took in a new terminal before launching:

```powershell
where sh
```

If that prints `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe`, Herdr started from there will
find it. If it prints nothing, the new server will fail the same way.

Check the setup:

```powershell
sh --version
herdr plugin action list
```

The action should report `"platforms":["linux","macos","windows"]`.

Two Windows details worth knowing:

- The `bash` on your `PATH` is probably not Git Bash. Windows ships a
  `bash.exe` stub in `WindowsApps` that launches WSL. This plugin never calls
  `bash`, and neither should anything you add to it.
- The `python3` on your `PATH` is probably the zero-byte Microsoft Store
  alias, which opens the Store instead of running Python. Lantern checks an
  interpreter by running it, so the field snapshot works with `python`, `py`,
  or a real `python3`. If none exists you lose the snapshot and nothing else.

Run Herdr for Windows natively. WSL is not the supported path.

## Tests

```bash
sh tests/smoke.sh
```

On Windows, run it through Git Bash:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe' tests/smoke.sh
```

GitHub Actions runs the same suite on Linux, macOS, and Windows for every pull
request.

## Trust

This runs as your user with your environment. Read `launch.sh`, `lib.sh`, and
`bin/herdr` before installing. Devin `HELPER_PERMISSION=dangerous` skips
Devin’s own approval UI; the herdr wrapper still requires `HERDR_HELPER_OK=1`
for mutating commands.

That wrapper gates mutating `herdr` subcommands only. It is not a sandbox: the
helper CLI it fronts has whatever tools you gave it, as you.

Earlier releases shipped the Lantern Bridge, which answered Telegram,
WhatsApp, and Slack with the same lantern. It was removed in 0.8.0: an
allowlisted sender got a shell on the machine running it, a fair trade for
one person on their own machine and not one for a team. The reasoning is
recorded in [plans/slack-app-discontinued.md](plans/slack-app-discontinued.md).
